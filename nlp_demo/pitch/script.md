# ⚡ ShadowPet: The 3-Minute Pitch

## 1. The Problem (30s)
[cite_start]"People hide their true feelings because they fear conflict, guilt, or making things worse." [cite: 50]
We've all been there. You feel ignored or overwhelmed, but you don't say anything because you don't want to start a fight.
So you stay silent. [cite_start]And the relationship suffers. [cite: 50]

## 2. The Solution (45s)
Enter **ShadowPet**.
[cite_start]It is a **Zero-Knowledge Emotional Mediator** disguised as a virtual pet. [cite: 51]
Here is how it works:
1. [cite_start]Partners privately input their feelings—like "stressed," "lonely," or "happy." [cite: 16]
2. [cite_start]Our **Zero-Knowledge Circuit** verifies these feelings mathematically. [cite: 18]
3. [cite_start]It updates a shared virtual pet to reflect the **relationship's combined state**. [cite: 20]

## 3. The "Magic" (Why ZK?) (45s)
[cite_start]This is crucial: **The raw text never leaves your phone.** [cite: 52]
* Partner A doesn't see Partner B's message.
* [cite_start]The Smart Contract doesn't see the message. [cite: 19]
* The world doesn't see it.

[cite_start]The only thing anyone sees is the Pet. [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]If both are stressed → The Pet enters **"Storm Mode"** (Conflict Prevention). [cite: 33, 35]
* [cite_start]If one is down → The Pet becomes **"Sleepy"** (Signal for Support). [cite: 31, 32]
* [cite_start]If words fail → You can **physically stroke the pet** to send a private proof of affection. [cite: 120]

## 4. The Tech Stack (45s)
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** Next.js with framer-motion for the "elastic" pet interactions. [cite: 138]
* [cite_start]**ZK Circuit:** Circom (Groth16) for verifying emotional integrity. [cite: 98]
* [cite_start]**Contract:** Midnight Compact to store the shared state immutably. [cite: 59]
* **Privacy:** Absolute. [cite_start]We prove the *condition* (e.g., "Both Stressed") without revealing the *data*. [cite: 40]

## 5. The Closing (15s)
[cite_start]ShadowPet turns raw vulnerability into a safe, playful signal. [cite: 168]
It helps couples bond better, privately.
**Privacy isn't just about hiding data. [cite_start]It's about creating a safe space to be honest.** [cite: 11]
